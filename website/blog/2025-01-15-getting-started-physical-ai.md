# Getting Started with Physical AI

Physical AI is transforming how we build intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that works purely in the digital realm, physical AI combines perception, reasoning, and action in real robotic systems.

## What Makes Physical AI Different?

Traditional AI systems process information and produce text or numeric outputs. Physical AI systems must:

- **Perceive** the physical world through sensors (cameras, lidar, proprioception)
- **Reason** about how to interact with it
- **Act** through actuators and mechanical systems

This adds complexity: you can't just deploy a model and hope it works—you need physics, control theory, and hardware expertise.

## The Core Challenges

### 1. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**
Training in simulation is fast and safe, but the real world is messy. Wind, friction, lighting variations—these all matter.

### 2. **Real-Time Constraints**
You can't wait minutes for an inference. Humanoid robots need control loop frequencies of 50-1000 Hz.

### 3. **Hardware-Software Co-Design**
The best physical AI systems require thinking about hardware and software together, not separately.

## Your Learning Path

Our textbook guides you through:
1. **Fundamentals** - Understand embodied AI principles
2. **Hardware** - Learn humanoid robot design
3. **Software** - Master ROS2 for robot programming
4. **Simulation** - Build digital twins in Isaac Sim
5. **Intelligence** - Implement vision-language-action models
6. **Integration** - Build a complete system (CoffeeBot)

## Why Learn Physical AI Now?

The convergence of three trends makes this the perfect time:
- **Transformer models** show zero-shot generalization across tasks
- **Robotics hardware** is becoming affordable and accessible
- **Open-source tools** (ROS2, Isaac Sim, HuggingFace) are maturing

## Next Steps

Start with Chapter 1 to understand the perception-action loop that powers all physical AI systems.
